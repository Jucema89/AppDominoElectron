# Electron App Domino
Aplicacion para gestion de torneos de domino lista para compilar en electron y transformarla en una app de escritorio.

![Instalacion](https://ibb.co/gDPrQtq)

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
